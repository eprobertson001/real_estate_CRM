# Real Estate CRM - Setup Instructions

## üöÄ Getting Started

Your Real Estate CRM project has been created! Follow these steps to complete the setup and start using your CRM.

## Step 1: Install Node.js

**Node.js is required to run this application.**

1. **Download Node.js:**
   - Go to [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)
   - Download the LTS version (recommended for most users)
   - Choose the Windows installer (.msi file)

2. **Install Node.js:**
   - Run the downloaded installer
   - Follow the installation wizard
   - ‚úÖ Make sure to check "Add to PATH" during installation
   - Restart your terminal/PowerShell after installation

3. **Verify Installation:**
   ```powershell
   node --version
   npm --version
   ```
   You should see version numbers for both commands.

## Step 2: Install Dependencies

Once Node.js is installed, run these commands in your project directory:

```powershell
# Install all project dependencies
npm install

# Generate the database client
npx prisma generate

# Set up the database
npx prisma db push
```

**‚úÖ Troubleshooting Step 2:**

If you encounter an **"upstream dependency conflict"** during `npm install`:
- This was already fixed in the project by replacing incompatible packages
- The installation should work normally now

If you get **"Environment variable not found: DATABASE_URL"** during Prisma commands:
- This is normal - a `.env` file is automatically created with the correct database URL
- The commands should work on retry

If you encounter **"Cannot find module 'autoprefixer'"** error:
- Run: `npm install --save-dev autoprefixer`
- Clear Next.js cache: `Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .next`
- Restart the development server: `npm run dev`

## Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

1. **Copy the environment template:**
   - The `.env.local` file contains all necessary environment variables
   - Update the following important settings:

```env
# Generate a strong secret for authentication
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-secure-secret-here"

# Google OAuth (for Gmail integration)
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="your-google-client-id"
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="your-google-client-secret"

# MLS API credentials
MLS_API_KEY="your-mls-api-key"

# Dotloop API credentials  
DOTLOOP_API_KEY="your-dotloop-api-key"
```

## Step 4: Start the Development Server

```powershell
npm run dev
```

The application will start at: **http://localhost:3000**
